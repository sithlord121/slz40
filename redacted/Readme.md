This is a one-shot version of the SLZ40.
The idea is to fit the SLZ in a standard 60% case.
The compromise that had to be made was that the top right key had to be moved to accomodate the case stand.

The PCB has the MCU and other components soldered.
This is the repository for the .json file to create custom keymaps as well as a default layout.
